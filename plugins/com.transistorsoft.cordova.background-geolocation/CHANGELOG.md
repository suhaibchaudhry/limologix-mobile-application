## [2.1.6] - 2016-11-08
- [Fixed] Android was only handling the first geofence event when multiple geofences fire simultaneously.  Issue #1004
- [Changed] The plugin will ignore `autoSyncThreshold` when a `motionchange` event occurs.
- [Fixed] Fixed ui-blocking issue when plugin boots with locations in its database with `autoSync: true`.  Found a case where the plugin was executing HTTP Service on the UI thread.  Fixes #995.
- [Fixed] Return current `state {Object}` in callback to `setConfig` (issue #985)
- [Fixed] iOS Scheduler puked when provided with a `null` or `[]` schedule.
- [Changed] iOS Scheduler behaviour changed to match Android, where `#stopSchedule` does **not** execute `#stop` on the plugin itself.

## [2.1.5] - 2016-11-04
- [Fixed] Issue #998.  FMDB [has issues](https://github.com/ccgus/fmdb/pull/180) binding array arguments (eg: DELETE FROM locations WHERE id IN(?)).  Solution is to simply compose the query string with concatenation.  Sanitization isn't required here anyway, since the ids come directly from my own query.
  
## [2.1.4] - 2016-11-02
- [Changed] Extract `CococaLumberjack` static-libary from compiled binary TSLocationManager.  It causes problems if other libs also use this dependency.  Extracted CocoaLumberjack to its own distinct plugin `cordova-plugin-cocoalumberjack`, which background-geolocation installs as a dependency.  This change should be completely transparent.

## [2.1.3] - 2016-10-19
- [Changed] Introduce database-logging for Android with [logback-android](https://github.com/tony19/logback-android).  Same API as iOS (@see `2.1.0`)
- [Fixed] iOS geofencing issue where multiple geofences trigger simultaneously, only the last geofence event would be transmitted to the client and persisted to database.
- [Fixed] Remove iOS motion-activity-based filtering of locations.  If a location was recorded while the motion-recognition system said the device was `still`, the location was ignored.  Fixes issue #954.
- [Changed] Implemented ability for iOS to trigger a geofence `ENTER` event immediately when device is already inside the geofence (Android has always done this).  This behaviour can be controlled with the new config `@param {Boolean} geofenceInitialTriggerEntry [true]`.  This behaviour defaults to `true`.

## [2.1.2] - 2016-10-17
- [Changed] Android will filter-out received locations detected to be same-as-last by comparing `latitude`, `longitude`, `speed` & `bearing`.
- [Fixed] Bug in `stopDetectionDelay` logic
- [Fixed] Geofencing transistion event logging wouldn't occur when configured for `debug: false`

## [2.1.1] - 2016-10-12
- [Fixed] Bug in Android geofencing

## [2.1.0] - 2016-10-10
- [Changed] Refactor iOS Logging system to use popular CocoaLumberjack library.  iOS logs are now stored in the database!  By default, logs are stored for 3 days, but is configurable with `logMaxDays`.  Logs can now be filtered by logLevel:

| logLevel | Label |
|---|---|
|`0`|`LOG_LEVEL_OFF`|
|`1`|`LOG_LEVEL_ERROR`|
|`2`|`LOG_LEVEL_WARNING`|
|`3`|`LOG_LEVEL_INFO`|
|`4`|`LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG`|
|`5`|`LOG_LEVEL_VERBOSE`|

`#getLog`, `#emailLog` operate in the same manner as before.

- [Fixed] If user declines "Motion Activity" permission, plugin failed to detect this authorization failure and fallback to the accelerometer-based motion-detection system.

- [Changed] Refactored Geolocation system.  The plugin is no longer bound by native platform limits on number of geofences which can be monitored (iOS: 20; Android: 100).  You may now monitor infinite geofences.  The plugin now stores geofences in its SQLite db and performs a geospatial query, activating only those geofences in proximity of the device (@config #geofenceProximityRadius, @event `geofenceschange`).  See the new [Geofencing Guide](./docs/geofencing.md)

## [2.0.13] - 2016-09-25
- [Fixed] Background-fetch event when causing app to boot in background, left plugin in preventSuspend mode when not configured to do so.

## [2.0.12] - 2016-09-25
- [Fixed] Bug in prevent-suspend where background-fetch operation where plugin was left in preventSuspend mode when not configured to do do

## [2.0.11] - 2016-09-22
- [Fixed] Bug in prevent-suspend where the plugin failed to re-start its prevent-suspend timer if no MotionActivity event occurred during that interval.  Prevent-suspend system should now operate completely independently of MotionDetector.
- [Fixed] `#stop` method wasn't calling `stopMonitoringSignificantChanges`, resulting in location-services icon failing to toggle OFF.  Fixes issue #908

## [2.0.10] - 2016-09-22
- [Fixed] Issue where iOS crashes when configured with null url.
- [Added] iOS `watchPosition` mechanism.
- [Changed] Refactored iOS motion-detection system.  Improved iOS motion-triggering when using `CMMotionActivityManager` (ie: when not using `disableMotionActivityUpdates: true`).  iOS can now trigger out of stationary-mode just like android, where it sees a 'moving-type' motion-activity (eg: 'on_foot', 'in_vehicle', etc).  Note: this will still occur only when your app isn't suspended (eg: app is in foreground, `preventSuspend: true`, or `#watchPosition` is engaged).
- [Changed] Refactored iOS "prevent suspend" system to be more robust.
- [Fixed] iOS locations sent to Javascript client had a different `uuid` than the one persisted to database (and synced to server).
-[Added] new iOS 10 .plist required key for accelerometer updates `NSMmotionUsageDescription` to `config.xml`.  Fixes #880
- [Added] New required android permission `<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.location.gps" />`.  Fixes #896

## [2.0.9] - 2016-08-29
- [Fixed] `removeGeofences` was removing stationary-region.  This would prevent stationary-exit if called while device is in stationary-mode
- [Fixed] Issue #830 Android pukes when it receives an empty schedule `[]`.
- [Fixed] Issue #824.  Android when configured with `batchSync: true, autoSync: true` was failing because the plugin automatically tweaked `autoSync: false` but failed to reset it to the configured value.  This behaviour was obsolete and has been removed.
- [Added] Add new config `@param {Integer} autoSyncThreshold [0]`.  Allows you to specify a minimum number of persisted records to trigger an auto-sync action.
- [Fixed] Issue #837.  Android `SimpleDateFormat` used for rendering location timestamp was not being used in a thread-safe manner, resulting in corrupted timestamps for some

## [2.0.8] - 2016-08-17
- [Fixed] Issue #804, null pointer exeception on mGoogleApiClient
- [Fixed] Issue #806.  PlayServices connect error event was fired before listeners arrive; Dialog to fix problem was never shown.
- [Changed] Removed `app-compat` from Gradle dependencies.
- [Changed] Fire http error callback when HTTP request is not 200ish (ie: 200, 201, 204).  Fixes issue #819.  Contradicts #774.
- [Changed] Remove `play-services:app-compat-v7` from Gradle dependencies
- [Fixed] Android heartbeat location wasn't having its meta-data updated (ie: `event: 'heartbeat', battery:<current-data>, uuid: <new uuid>`)
- [Changed] Reduce Android `minimumActivityRecognitionConfidence` default from `80` to `75` (issue #825)
- [Changed] Android will ask for location-permission when `#configure` is executed, rather than waiting for `#start`.
- [Changeed] Android will catch `java.lang.SecurityException` when attempting to request location-updates without "Location Permission"

## [2.0.7] - 2016-08-08
- [Fixed] Scheduler parsing issue #785.

## [2.0.6] Skipped to sync version with Lite version
## [2.0.5] - 2016-08-07
- [Fixed] `addGeofences` issue #778
- [Fixed] iOS setting `method` not being respected (was always doing `POST`).  Issue #770
- [Changed] Implement latest version of `cordova-plugin-background-fetch` dependency (v4.0.0)
- [Changed] iOS Plugin will perform HTTP sync on background-fetch event.
- [Changed] Implemented latest version of `cordova-plugin-background-fetch@4.0.0`.

## [2.0.4] - 2016-07-28
- [Changed] Major Android refactor with significant architectural changes.  Introduce new `adapter.BackgroundGeolocation`, a proxy between the Cordova plugin and `BackgroundGeolocationService`.  Up until now, the functionality of the plugin has been contained within a large, monolithic Android Service class.  This monolithic functionality has mostly been moved into the proxy object now, in addition to spreading among a number of new Helper classes.  The functionality of the HTTP, SQLite, Location and ActivityRecognition layers are largely unchanged, just re-orgnanized.  This new structure will make it much easier going forward with adding new features.
- [Changed] SQLite & HTTP layers have been moved from the BackgroundGeolocationService -> the proxy.  This means that database & http operations can now be performed without enabling the plugin with start() method.
- [Changed] Upgrade EventBus to latest.
- [Changed] Implement new watchPosition method (Android-only), allowing you to get a continues stream of locations without using Javascript setInterval (Android-only currently)
- [Added] Implement new event "providerchange" allowing you to listen to Location-services change events (eg: user turns off GPS, user turns off location services).  Whenever a "providerchange" event occurs, the plugin will automatically fetch the current position and persist the location adding the event: "providerchange" as well as append the provider state-object to the location.
- [Changed] Significantly simplified Cordova plugin (CDVBackgroundGeolocation.java) by moving boiler-plate code into the Proxy object.  This significantly simplifies the Cordova plugin, making it much easier to support all the different frameworks the plugin has been ported to (ie: React Native, NativeScript).
- [Changed] Disable iOS start-detection system when no accelerometer detected (ie: when running in simulator, fixes issue #767)
- [Changed] Refactor iOS location-authorization request system.  The plugin will now constantly check the status of location-authorization and show an Alert popup directing the user to the **Settings** screen if the user changes the state to anything other than what you requested (eg: user changes authorization-request to `WhenInUse` or `Never` when you requestd `Always`)
- [Fixed] `stopOnTerminate` on iOS was broken when app is closed while in background.  

## [1.7.0] - 2016-07-18
- [Changed] `Scheduler` will use `Locale.US` in its Calendar operations, such that the days-of-week correspond to Sunday=1..Saturday=7.  Fixes issue #659
- [Changed] Refactor odometer calculation for both iOS and Android.  No longer filters out locations based upon average location accuracy of previous 10 locations; instead, it will only use the current location for odometer calculation if it has accuracy < 100.
- [Fixed] Missing iOS setting `locationAuthorizationRequest after Settings service refactor
- [Added] **Android-only currently, beta** New geofence-only tracking-mode, where the plugin will not actively track location, only geofences.  This mode is engaged with the new API method `#startGeofences` (instead of `#start`, which engages the usual location-tracking mode).  `#getState` returns a new param `#trackingMode [location|geofences]`
- [Changed] **Android** Refactor the Android "Location Request" system to be more robust and better handle "single-location" requests / asynchronous requests, such as `#getCurrentPosition` and stationary-position to fetch multiple samples (3), selecting the most accurate (ios has always done this, heard with the debug sound `tick`).  In debug mode, you'll hear these location-samples with new debug sound "US dialtone".  Just like iOS, these location-samples will be returned to your `#onLocation` event-listener with the property `{sample: true}`.  If you're doing your own HTTP in Javascript, you should **NOT** send these locations to your server.  Use them instead to simply update the current position on the Map, if you're using one.
- [Added] new `#getCurrentPosition` options `#samples` and `#desiredAccuracy`. `#samples` allows you to configure how many location samples to fetch before settling sending the most accurate to your `callbackFn`.  `#desiredAccuracy` will keep sampling until an location having accuracy `<= desiredAccuracy` is achieved (or `#timeout` elapses).
- [Added] new `#event` type `heartbeat` added to `location` params (`#is_heartbeat` is **@deprecated**).
- [Fixed] Issue #676.  Don't engage foreground-service when executing `#getCurrentPosition` while plugin is in disabled state.
- [Fixed] When enabling iOS battery-state monitoring, use setter method `setBatteryMonitoringEnabled` rather than setting property.  This seems to have changed with latest iOS
- [Fixed] error-callback incorrectly fired when `getCurrentPosition` is called while service is stopped (Fixes issue #691)
- [Added] Implement `disableStopDetection` for Android (Fixes issue #692)
- [Changed] `android.permission.GET_TASKS` changed to `android.permission.GET_REAL_TASKS`.  Hoping this removes deprecation warning.  This permission is required for Android `#forceReload` configs.
- [Added] New Anddroid config `#notificationIcon`, allowing you to customize the icon shown on notification when using `foregroundServcie: true`.
- [Changed] Take better care with applying `DEFAULT` settings for both iOS & Android.
- [Changed] Default settings: `startOnBoot: false`, `stopOnTerminate: true`, `distanceFilter: 10`.
- [Added] Allow setting `isMoving` as a config param to `#configure`.  Allows the plugin to automatically do a `#changePace` to your desired value when the plugin is first `#configure`d.
- [Added] New event `activitychange` for listening to changes from the Activit Recognition system.  See **Events** section in API docs for details.  Fixes issue #703.
- [Added] Allow Android `foregroundService` config to be changed dynamically with `#setConfig` (used to have to restart the start to apply this).
- [Added] Implement the new `#getCurrentPosition` options `#samples` and `#desiredAccuracy` for iOS.
- [Changed] Revert GET_REAL_TASKS back to GET_TASKS
## [1.6.3] - 2016-05-25
- [Fixed] Rebuild binary `tslocationmanager.aar` excluding dependencies `appcompat-v7` and `play-services`.  I was experiencing build-failures with react-native since other libs may include these dependencies:

## [1.6.2] - 2016-05-24
- [Fixed] Android `GeofenceService` namespace was changed but the `plugin.xml` file was not updated with the new namespace.

## [1.6.1] - 2016-05-22
- [Changed] Refactor iOS motion-detection system.  When not set to `disableMotionActivityUpdates` (default), the  plugin will not activate the accelerometer and will rely instead purely upon updates from the **M7** chip.  When `disableMotionActivityUpdates` **is** set to `false`, the pure acceleromoeter based activity-detection has been improved to give more accurate results of the detected activity (ie: `on_foot, walking, stationary`)
- [Fixed] Fixed configuration bug which could incorrectly set `pausesLocationUpdatesAutomatically` to false, preventing the plugin from automatically turning off location-updates.

## [1.6.0] - 2016-05-17
- [Added] Implement new Scheduling feature for iOS and Android.
- [Fixed] Bugs in iOS option `useSignificantChangesOnly`
- [Changed] Refactor HTTP Layer for both iOS and Android to stop spamming server when it returns an error (used to keep iterating through the entire queue).  It will now stop syncing as soon as server returns an error (good for throttling servers).
- [Added] Migrate iOS settings-management to new Settings service
- [Fixed] bugs in Scheduler
- [Fixed] Fix bug where Android was not JSON decoding the location object sent to heartbeat event #646
- [Added] Better BackgroundFetch plugin integration.  Background-fetch will retrieve the location-state when a fetch event fires.  This can help to trigger stationary-exit since bg-fetch typically fires about every 15min.
- [Added] Improved functionality with `stopOnTerminate: false`.  Ensure a stationary-geofence is created when plugin is closed while in **moving** state; this seems to improve the time it takes to trigger the iOS app awake after terminate.  When plugin *is* rebooted in background due to geofence-exit, the plugin will briefly sample the accelerometer to see if device is currently moving.

## [1.5.1] - 2016-04-12
- [Added] ios logic to handle being launched in the background (by a background-fetch event, for example).  When launched in the background, iOS will essentially do a `changePace(true)` upon itself and let the stop-detection system determine engage stationary-mode as detected.
- [Changed] ios halt stop-detection distance was using `distanceFilter`; changed to use `stationaryRadius`.  This effects users using the accelerometer-based stop-detection system:  after stop is detected, the device must move `stationaryRadius` meters away from location where stop was detected.
- [Fixed] Android `addGeofences` callbacks not being called.
- [Changed] When `maxRecordsToPersist == 0`, don't persist any record.
- [Added] Implement `startOnBoot` param for iOS.  iOS always ignored `startOnBoot`.  If you set `startOnBoot: false` now, iOS will not begin tracking when launched in background after device is rebooted (eg: from a background-fetch event, geofence exit or significant-change event)
- [Changed] Modified the method signature of `#configure`.  The config `{}` will now be the 1st param and the `callbackFn` will now signal successful configuration.  The `locationCallback` and `locationErrorCallback` must now be provided with a separate event-listener `#onLocation`.
- [Fixed] Bug in `getCurrentPosition` timeout when plugin is disabled.

## [1.5.0] - 2016-04-04
- [Fixed] Fixed issue #597, `NullPointerException` after `startOnBoot`
- [Fixed] Refactor `startOnBoot` system.  Moved `BootReceiver` to `com.transistorsoft.cordova.bggeo` namespace.
- [Added] New config option `#forceReloadOnBoot` for specifying the MainActivity should launch after a `startOnBoot` occurs.
## [1.5.0] - 2016-04-04
- [Added] Intelligence for `stopTimeout`.  When stop-timer is initiated, save a reference to the current-location.  If another location is recorded while during stop-timer, calculate the distance from location when stop-timer initiated:  if `distance > stationaryRadius`, cancel the stop-timer and stay in "moving" state.
- [Added] New debug sound **"booooop"**:  Signals the initiation of stop-timer of `stopTimeout` minutes.
- [Added] New debug sound **"boop-boop-boop"**: Signals the cancelation of stop-timer due to movement beyond `stationaryRadius`.
- [Fixed] When using setConfig to change `distanceFilter` while location-updates are already engaged, was mistakenly using value for `desiredAccuracy`!
- [Fixed] iOS Issue with timers not running on main-thread.
- [Fixed] iOS Issue with acquriring stationary-location on a stale location.  Ensure the selected stationary-location is no older than 1s.
- [Fixed] iOS Removed some log messages appearing when `{debug: false}`
- [Fixed] Android 5 geofence limit.  Refactored Geofence system.  Was using a `PendingIntent` per geofence; now uses a single `PendingIntent` for all geofences.
- [Fixed] Edge-case issue #540 when executing `#getCurrentPosition` followed immediately by `#start` in cases where location-timeout occurs.
- [Changed] Update Android Volley dependency to official version
- [Changed] When Android #stop is called, update `isMoving` state to `false`
- [Fixed] ios `stopOnTerminate` was defaulting to `false`.  Docs say default is `true`.
- [Fixed] ios `useSignificantChangesOnly` was broken.
- [Fixed] If location-request times-out while acquiring stationary-location, try to use last-known-location
- [Added] Add odometer to ios location JSON schema
- [Added] ios Log network reachability flags on connection-type changes.
- [Added] `maxRecordsToPersist` to limit the max number of records persisted in plugin's SQLite database.
- [Added] API methods `#addGeofences` (for adding a list-of-geofences), `#removeGeofences`
- [Changed] The plugin will no longer delete geofences when `#stop` is called; it will merely stop monitoring them.  When the plugin is `#start`ed again, it will start monitoringt any geofences it holds in memory.  To completely delete geofences, use new method `#removeGeofences`.
- [Fixed] iOS battery `is_charging` was rendering as `1/0` instead of boolean `true/false`
- [Fixed] Issue with `forceReloadOnX` params. These were not forcing the activity to reload on device reboot when configured with `startOnBoot: true`.  Implemented a better method for detecting when main Activity is active.
- [Fixed] `getOdometer` callabck wasn't running if BackgroundGeolocationService wasn't running.
- [Changed] When Activity is `forceReload`ed (eg: via `forceReloadOnLocationChange`), the Activity will automatically be minimized when launched now!

## [1.4.0] - 2016-03-08
- [Changed] Introduce new per-app licensing scheme.  I'm phasing out the unlimited 'god-mode' license in favour of generating a distinct license-key for each bundle ID.  This cooresponds with new Customer Dashboard for generating application keys and managing team-members.

## [1.3.0]

- [Changed] Upgrade `emailLog` method to attach log as email-attachment rather than rendering to email-body.  The result of `#getState` is now rendered to the 

##0.6.4

- pin google-play-services at 7.5.0 to help people suffering from Google Play Services bug
- Tweak stop-detection system.  add `#stopDetectionDelay`

## 0.6.3
- Introduce accelerometer-base stop-detection for ios.
- `@config {Boolean} useSignificantChangesOnly`
- When a geofence event occurs, the associated location will have geolocation meta-data attached to the associated location.  Find it in the POST data.  See Wiki Location Data Schema for details.
